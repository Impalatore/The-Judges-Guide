This category covers infractions involving general play errors a Duelist might commit during the course of
a game.
\
\
There are 3 sub-categories for Procedural Error: Minor, Major, and Strict; which indicate the severity of
the infraction.

---

## Minor (Warning)

This penalty is appropriate for minor infractions where the problem can be easily corrected.


| PE Minor Examples |
| ----------------- |
| Both players forget to resolve a Mandatory Effect, and the game state is repairable by a judge. Since both players are responsible, they each receive a Warning. |
| A player attempts to Summon a monster while an effect prohibits him from doing so. |
| A player accidentally changes the order of the cards in her Graveyard. |
| A player shifts the position of a card on his field when he has not been directed to do so by a card effect or game mechanic. |
| A player rushes from his Main Phase 1 straight into declaring an attack with his Monster without notifying his opponent that he is changing Phases and giving his opponent the opportunity to respond to the changing of Phases. |
| Players are not keeping a paper record of their Life Points. |
| A player Normal Summons a monster and then attempts to retract the move. |
| A player does not fully reveal a card that was retrieved from her Deck, Graveyard, etc. via an effect that searches for a card. |

## Major (Game Loss)

This penalty is appropriate for major infractions that cause an irreversible disruption to the current game. The game is beyond repair, so the penalty must be significant.


| PE Major Examples |
| ----------------- |
| A player shuffles his hand into his Deck by accident. |
| A player forgets to pay a maintenance cost and doesn’t catch it until a few turns later, after she realizes she should have run out of Life Points during a previous turn. |
| A player forgets to pay a maintenance cost and doesn’t catch it until a few turns later, after she realizes she should have run out of Life Points during a previous turn. |
| A player forgets to discard down to the legal hand limit at the end of his turn. During his opponent's turn he plays a card that draws a card. There is no way to know which cards the player had in his hand prior to drawing the card. This is not a missed mandatory effect but a mandatory game mechanic. This action is irreparable, and it is appropriate to give the player a Game Loss. |

## Strict (Match Loss)

This penalty is appropriate for infractions that cause a player to be unable to finish the current match.

| PE Strict Examples |
| ------------------ |
| A player spills water on her Deck and damages her cards, which makes it impossible to finish the current Match. |
| A player loses his Deck in between Matches and does not notify the scorekeeper until after the round has already been paired. |
