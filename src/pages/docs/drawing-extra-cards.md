title: Drawing Extra Cards
description: Quidem magni aut exercitationem maxime rerum eos.
---

This category covers infractions associated with drawing cards from the Deck outside of when a Duelist is
allowed to do so.

---

## Minor: (Warning)

This penalty is appropriate when a Duelist has drawn cards from their Deck when not allowed to
do so, and the cards can be clearly identified by both Duelists or logically identified by a judge.

* This penalty also applies to situations in which cards are accidentally revealed.
* The cards should be shown to both Duelists and then returned to their original areas, in their original order.


| DC Minor Examples |
| ------------------ |
| A player accidentally draws a card when not allowed to do so but does not add the card to her hand. |
| A player accidentally draws a card and adds it to his hand. A judge is able to logically identify which card was drawn due to effects that have already been played. |
| A player accidentally knocks over cards from the top of her Deck. |

## Major (Game Loss)

This penalty is appropriate when a Duelist has unintentionally drawn cards from their Deck when
not allowed to do so, and the cards cannot be clearly identified by both Duelists or logically
identified by a judge.

* Drawing extra cards when not allowed to do so damages the Game State and must carry a heavier penalty.
* A judge should always attempt to recreate the situation to logically determine which card(s) were drawn. If the judge or both Duelists are not completely sure which card(s) were drawn, this penalty applies.

| DC Major Examples |
| ------------------ |
| A player accidentally draws an extra card via an effect and adds it to her hand, with no way to correctly identify which card was added. |
| A player resolves an effect that searches for a card, selects a card from his Deck, and then adds it to his hand without revealing the card to the opponent. Neither the opponent or a Judge is able to positively identify the card that was added to the hand. |
