title: Marked Cards
description: Quidem magni aut exercitationem maxime rerum eos.
---

This category covers infractions involving Marked Cards and/or sleeves.

* A card or sleeve is considered to be “marked” if it can be distinguished from the other cards
  contained in a Deck, while the cards are face-down.
* Markings include (but are not limited to) dirt, edge discolorations, creases or tears, flimsy texture,
  damaged corners, shifting within sleeves, etc. Markings can occur on the card, the sleeve, or both.
* It is a Duelist’s responsibility to maintain un-marked cards and sleeves throughout the duration of
  a tournament.
* Marked Card infractions apply to all cards in all Decks, including Main, Side, and Extra.
* If the Deck is double sleeved, markings apply to both the inner and outer sleeves.

## Minor: (Warning)

This penalty is appropriate when a Duelist has minor markings on one or very few cards in their
Deck that show no significant pattern.

* If the markings are on the sleeves, the Duelist should be required to change the sleeves so that the entire Deck matches.
* If the cards themselves are marked, the Duelist must replace the cards.
* It is appropriate for a judge to allow a Duelist to change the sleeves in between rounds as to not hold up the current Match.

It is important for judges to understand that a pattern should not be presumed merely because
the card(s) marked are “good” cards.


| MC Minor Examples |
| ------------------ |
| A player has two random sleeves in his Deck with minor wear and tear, The two cards in the sleeves bear no pattern. |
| A player has three cards in his Deck with minor bends that can be noticed through the sleeves. The three cards bear no pattern. |


## Major (Game Loss)

This penalty is appropriate when a Duelist has a significant number of cards marked and a judge
notices there isn’t a significant pattern.
* This penalty should be applied if the Head Judge determines that the pattern is insignificant and unintentional.
* It is appropriate for a judge to allow a Duelist to change the sleeves in between rounds as to not hold up the current Match.
* Although this infraction assumes the marking is unintentional, any markings on a card or sleeve can give a significant advantage to a player, so it carries a heavier penalty.
* It is very important for a Head Judge to investigate further to make sure the markings are not intentional.


| MC Major Examples |
| ------------------ |
| A player has 12 sleeves with what seems to be wear and tear on the top left corner. The marking is on eight of the 12 Spell Cards the player is playing in his Main Deck. The Head Judge determines the markings were made accidentally due to the way the player holds his cards. |
| A player has 14 normally-sleeved cards turned upside down in his Deck during a mid-round Deck Check, ten of which are Monster Cards. The Head Judge determines these cards made up the player’s Graveyard during the previous Game, and the player unintentionally shuffled them back in the wrong direction. |
| A player has 3 cards with additional wear and tear on the top left corner. The marking is the only three Trap Cards the player is playing in his Main Deck. The Head Judge determines the markings were made accidentally based on how the player handles his face-down Spell/Trap Cards. |
| A player is playing with cards that have been altered from their original manufactured state. The markings make it so that the player/Judge is unable to determine which card it is at first glance or the rarity has been altered from how it was manufactured by Konami. The player should receive a Game Loss for Marked Cards and is required to appropriately replace the card(s) in question. |


## Strict (Match Loss)

This penalty is appropriate when a Duelist has a significant number of cards marked and a judge
notices a significant pattern.
* This penalty should be applied if the Head Judge determines that the pattern is unintentional.
* If this occurs near the end of a round or in between rounds, it is appropriate for the Head Judge to provide an appropriate time extension for the player to fix the issue.
* Although this infraction assumes the marking is unintentional, any markings on a card or sleeve that bear a significant pattern can give a significant advantage to a player, even if the Duelist was unaware of the pattern.
* Duelists should be required to fix all errors with the cards and/or sleeves before being allowed to continue play.
* It is very important for a Head Judge to investigate further to make sure the markings are not intentional.


| MC Strict Examples |
| ------------------ |
| During a judge call near the end of the round, a Duelist is found with 15 cards from their Side Deck that are warped. Upon investigation, the Head Judge determines that this was unintentional. The entire Side Deck is considered to be marked with a significant pattern. The Duelist should receive a Match Loss for Marked Cards and will need to replace the cards or remove them from their Side Deck before being allowed to continue play. If the cards are being removed, the Deck List should be updated accordingly. It is appropriate for the Head Judge to provide a time extension into the next round, to provide the player with an opportunity to properly correct the issue. |
| During a mid-round Deck check, a Duelist is found with 6 sleeves of a slightly different shade of color than the color of the rest of his Main Deck. Upon investigation, the Head Judge determines that the player ran out of sleeves while sleeving his Side Deck and the entire Side Deck is currently using a different pack of sleeves than the Main Deck, and the Duelist seemed to be genuinely unaware of the difference. The entire Side Deck is considered to be marked with a significant pattern. The Duelist should receive a Match Loss for Marked Cards and will need to replace the sleeves before being allowed to continue play. |
