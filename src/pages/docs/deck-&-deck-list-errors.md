## Minor: (Warning)

This penalty is appropriate when a Duelist realizes they have an illegal Deck or Deck List and brings
it to the attention of tournament staff before the tournament begins.
\
\
This penalty is also appropriate if any Deck List content needs to be confirmed.

| DE Minor Examples |
| ----------------- |
| A player accidentally marks two copies of a Limited card on her Deck List and brings it up to a tournament official prior to Round 1.
| A player has 39 cards in his Main Deck and brings it up to a tournament official prior to Round 1, and is able to add another tournament legal card to bring the total to 40 before the round begins. |
| A player arrives at his Match and prior to presenting his Deck to his opponent to randomize, realizes he forgot to remove Side Deck cards from the previous Match. The player must restore the Deck within the three-minute window, or risk an additional penalty for Tardiness. |
| A player has accidentally shuffled an Extra Deck card into his Main Deck, and draws it from his Deck during a game. He should show the Extra Deck card to his opponent and a judge, return the Extra Deck card to his Extra Deck, and draw a new card. |
| A player’s handwriting is impossible to read, and a judge is obligated to clarify the name of a card or cards by checking with the player.
| A player is playing with a legal foreign language version of a card but does not have a translation kept outside of her Deck. |
| A player unintentionally registers a card incorrectly during Sealed pack play and the error is caught during Deck construction. The player that registered the card pool should receive a Warning. |
| A player unintentionally enters an event with a card that is determined to be counterfeit. The player should be allowed to replace the card with an actual version of the card and receive a Warning. |

## Major (Game Loss)

This penalty is appropriate if a player registers an illegal Deck List, has an illegal Deck, or the Deck List does not match the contents of the Deck and the player does not catch the errors before Round 1 begins.

If the player has registered a legal Deck List but the Deck is illegal and/or does not match the Deck List, the Deck List takes priority over the contents of the Deck. In this case, the Deck should be fixed to match the Deck List.

It is the player’s responsibility to obtain any cards needed to match the Deck to the Deck List before continuing game play. If the player does not have access to the necessary cards the player may add only enough cards to the Deck from the Side Deck to make the Deck legal, then correct the Deck List. If the player is not using a Side Deck, and cannot make the Deck match the Deck list, the player cannot continue in the tournament and should be dropped from the event.

If a player registers the wrong card name in the Deck List, and the card written is an Official Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG card, then the Deck List is still legal. The Deck is illegal and should be fixed to match the Deck List. If the player does not have access to the listed card or is unable to use the card in that portion of the Deck (Synchro Monster listed in Main Deck, etc), then if the Main Deck total is still legal, fix the Deck List. If the Main Deck total is illegal, the player must use cards from his/her Side Deck to make the Main Deck legal. If the player is not using a Side Deck, and cannot obtain the necessary card(s), the player cannot continue in the tournament and should be dropped from the event.

If finding the necessary cards makes the player tardy for the Match, the appropriate Tardiness penalties apply in addition to the Deck Error Game Loss.

If the player has registered an illegal Deck List but the Deck is legal, a judge should ensure the player fixes the Deck List to match the Deck.

If a player registers the wrong card name on the Deck List, and the card written is an Official Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG Card, but the card is a Forbidden card, than the Deck List is illegal. If the Deck is legal, the Deck List should be fixed to match the Deck.

If the player has registered both an illegal Deck List and Deck, a judge should ensure the player fixes the Deck first by removing all illegal cards from the Deck (Forbidden Cards, OCG Cards, extra copies of Limited/Semi-Limited cards, etc) and then fix the Deck List to match the Deck. If removing the illegal copies makes it so the Deck is still legal, no additional cards may be added to replace the illegal cards and the player must correct the Deck List. If removing the illegal copies makes the Deck illegal, the player may add only enough cards to the Deck from the Side Deck to make the Deck legal, then correct the Deck List. Cards may not be added to the Side Deck to replace the transferred cards. If the player is not using a Side Deck, and cannot make a legal Deck, the player cannot continue in the tournament and should be dropped from the event.

If a Deck Check has already been performed in which the Deck List has been verified as legal, the Deck List cannot be changed. In this case, if the Deck does not match the Deck List, a judge should ensure the player fixes the Deck to match the Deck List.

| DE Major Examples |
| ----------------- |
| A player has 41 cards listed in his Deck List and has 41 cards in his Main Deck. The player lists Honest, a Limited card, three times on the Deck List. He also has all three copies in his Main Deck. The two illegal copies of Honest should be removed from the Deck. Since the player now has an illegal Deck (39 cards), he must choose one card from his Side Deck and add it to his Main Deck. The Deck List should be fixed to match the Deck. |
| A player has 42 cards listed in his Deck List and has 42 cards in his Main Deck. The player lists Honest, a Limited card, three times on the Deck List. He also has all three copies in his Main Deck. The two illegal copies of Honest should be removed from the Deck. Since the player still has a legal Deck (40 cards), he may not modify his Deck. The Deck List should be fixed to match the Deck. |
| A player has 39 cards in her Main Deck. The player will add a card to the Main Deck from the Side Deck. The Deck List should be fixed to match the Deck. |
| A player forgets to remove Side Deck cards from his Deck in between rounds, and the error is caught after the Deck has been presented to his opponent for randomization. |
| A player registers “Bottomless”, “Mirror”, “Stardust”, etc, on her Deck List. The Deck List should be fixed. |
| A player registers Black Luster Soldier in her Deck List. Upon verification, the player is playing Black Luster Soldier – Envoy of the Beginning. If Black Luster Soldier – Envoy of the Beginning is not on the forbidden list, and it is an actual card in the Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG, the Deck should be fixed to match the Deck List – the player must play with Black Luster Soldier, the card named on the Deck List. |
