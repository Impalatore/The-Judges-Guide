Whether or not a game state can be repaired can mean the difference between a Warning and a Game Loss. If both players can provide clear information and a judge can determine a way to fix or rewind the game state, the game should be repaired as far as possible and play should resume. A Game Loss is not an appropriate penalty for a repairable game state, unless as an upgrade from previous infractions.

\
An irreparable game state should never result in a double Game Loss, except as an upgrade. If both players share fault in a single game state error that merits a Game Loss, determine which player is most at fault, and award that player with the Game Loss. The player less at fault should receive a Warning. An irreparable game state should never result in restarting a Duel or Match.


## Irreparable Game States

| Irreparable Game Examples |
| ------------------ |
| A player returns a face-down monster to her Deck to Special Summon Gladiator Beast Heraklinos from her Extra Deck, without revealing it to their opponent. There is no way to tell if the face-down card was a “Gladiator Beast” Monster, so the action is irreparable. It is appropriate to give the player a Game Loss. |
| A player forgets to discard down to the legal hand limit at the end of his turn. During their opponent's turn he plays a card that draws a card. There is no way to know which cards the player had in his hand prior to drawing the card. This is not a missed mandatory effect but a mandatory game mechanic. This action is irreparable, and it is appropriate to give the player a Game Loss. |

## Reparable Game States

| Irreparable Game Examples |
| ------------------ |
| A player shuffles his hand with his Deck. However, he had revealed his hand to the opponent earlier in the turn, and has not drawn or played any additional cards. Both the player and the opponent can clearly remember the contents of the player’s hand. It is appropriate for the player to restore his hand, reshuffle his deck, and continue play with a Warning. |
| Neither player has been keeping track of Life Points on paper for the current Game and there is a disagreement about the Life Point totals. The players, with the aid of a judge, should reconstruct the game from the cards that have been played, and either reach an agreement or accept the judge’s decision on the totals. Both players should receive a Warning and be allowed to continue play. |
| A player activates an effect to search for a card without a legal target in her Deck. After the player is unable to resolve the search effect, the Deck is shuffled, the player should receive a Warning, and be allowed to continue play. |
| A player forgets to resolve a mandatory effect and the error is not caught until a few game plays later. After investigation, the Head Judge determines the infraction was unintentional. Both players should receive a Warning as it is both players’ responsibility to maintain the correct Game State, and game play should continue from that point. |
