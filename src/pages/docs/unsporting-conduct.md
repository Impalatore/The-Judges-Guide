title: Unsporting Conduct
description: Quidem magni aut exercitationem maxime rerum eos.
---

This category covers infractions associated with inappropriate behavior from a person, usually during a
tournament.

* Unsporting Conduct infractions are considered to be intentional.
* Unsporting Conduct infractions may be committed by persons not enrolled in the tournament.
It is important for persons to understand what kinds of behavior are not appropriate at an event, and for
judges to use common sense when investigating the infraction and administering a penalty.
* While Konami encourages persons to have fun at a tournament, they are expected to withhold
from engaging in behavior that may be offensive or that may ruin the integrity of the event.
